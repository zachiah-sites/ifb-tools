	<p class="mb-4">
		Please note that IFB Tools is in VERY early development, so lots of things are incomplete or
		buggy. For an example just click the map icon on the bottom.

		If you find any issues relating to the sermon editor or Bible that I don't have yet, please
		report them on <a href="https://github.com/zachiah-sites/ifb-tools"
