# IFB Tools

This site is designed for Independent Fundemental Baptists.

Here you can read/memorize the Bible(KJV), watch Biblical preaching and more.

### What is the IFB?

The IFB contains people who believe and preach the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation.

Examples of beliefs are:

1: Salvation is by faith alone.

2: Once a person is saved, they are always saved.

**NOTE**: If you are not 100% sure you will go to Heaven when you die, please watch [The Bible Way to Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgAvQbVrSIM&ab_channel=VerityBaptistChurch)

3: Baptism occurs after salvation.

4: The King James Version of the Bible is the only accurate word of God in Einglish today. All modern versions are perversions of Satan.

5: We believe that Jesus was born of a virgin named Mary, that he lived a perfect/sinless life, died on the cross, was buried and rose again.

6: The Trinity is a concept found in Scripture.

# Contributing

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
